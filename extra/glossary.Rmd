```{r}
glossary_add("primary data", "Data generated by the researcher using surveys, interviews, experiments or other sources to explore a research problem.")

glossary_add("secondary data", "Data that previously existed to explore a research problem, generally not generated by the researcher using the data.")

glossary_add("semantic priming", "Semantic priming occurs when someone processes a second word faster after seeing a related word first. For example, you will read the word DOG faster if you see CAT before it in comparison to SPOON.")
